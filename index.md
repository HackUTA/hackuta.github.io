    "What's a hackathon?",
    "A hackathon is best described as an \"invention marathon\". Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in Computer Science."
  ],
  [
    "How do I apply?",
    "Just scroll up to the top and click on that \"Register\" button. Once you fill out the application you're good to go! We'll be sending out acceptance letters in the next few weeks."
  ],
  [
    "What can I make?",
    "Whatever your heart desires! A website, an app, a video game with super VR features, a robot that gives people high fives, the list goes on. Your project will be judged based off its creativity, innovation, coolness factor and technical skills involved."
  ],
  [
    "Can I work on something I've already created?",
    "If you'd like to be judged, no. Masters thesis, your previous mobile apps, previous anything, homework. Unles you're starting from scratch and creating something new in 24 hours, it goes against the hackathon spirit."
  ],
  [
    "Who can attend?",
    "Any graduate/undergrate student who is over 18. Any experience, any background, any education, any text editor, you're welcome to attend!"
  ],
  [
    "Teams?",
    "Teams can be up to 4 people. If you don't have a team yet, we'll help you find out! You can do it alone but it's not as fun."
  ],
  [
    "What if I don't have experience?",
    "That is 100% Okay! We will have several workshops, mentors and even skilled students to help you out! We just want you to have fun and build something cool."
  ],
  [
    "What should I bring?",
    "Bring a valid student ID, yourself and anything to contribute to your hack. This includes a laptop, charger, mouse, keyboard, and your five 27\" monitors if you wanna be THAT kid."
  ],
  [
    "You didn't answer my questions",
    "I'm sorry, we tried. Email us at hello@hackuta.com"
