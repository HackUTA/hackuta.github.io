        HackUTA is University of Texas at Arlington's first ever 24 hour hackathon, hosted by UTA students.
        The event will take place in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nedderman+Hall/" target="_blank">Nedderman Hall</a> on the weekend of September 30th and October 1st. HackUTA is more than just
        software, it's getting together to innovate, work with others and create something cool in
        24 hours.

        What's a hack? Projects range from VR Flappy Bird, to IOT sticker vending machines, to
        an app that uses machine learning to create a song. This all sounds fancy but even a simple
        website to help fight hunger is considered a hack!
